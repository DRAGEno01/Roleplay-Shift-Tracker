# Roleplay Shift Tracker

An application where you can track your shift hours in different roleplay games and departments.

This free open-source application allows roleplayers to not stress about their shift time requirements, but instead allows them to keep account of themselves and keep on track with the amount of hours they need to do.
## Installation

Install RpShiftTracker using the Python installer and follow the steps of the installation.

```bash
  You WILL need 'Python' and 'pip' installed to be able to use the app and installer.
```
    
## FAQ

#### Does this automatically track time?

No. You will need to manually start and stop the time tracking.

#### Can I close the application while on duty?

Yes! It will automatically resume from where you left off and keep tracking time even while closed (but the overlay wont work if fully closed).
